# Geocoding and Geomarker Assessment

- The role of the environment in health has been known for decades, but the data and tools needed to characterize the relationship at a population level have only recently become available.

- **Geocoding**: Converting a string of text into latitude and longitude coordinates

<center>
*place (+ time) â†’ estimated past "exposures"*
</center>

- **Geomarker**: Similar to biomarkers in precision health and defined as any objective, contextual, or geographic measure that influences or predicts the incidence of outcome or disease

    - community deprivation, crime, cultural isolation indices 
    - census, surveys
    - airborne pollutants
    - landcover classification (Figure 1a), greenspace (Figure 1b)
    - access to healthcare (Figure 1c), healthy food, pharmacies, transportation
    - noise, heat, walkability, parks, proximity to roads/traffic (Figure 1d)

```{r fig1, out.width='80%', fig.cap='Geomarker Examples', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/geomarkers.png')
```

# Privacy and Reproducibility in Health Studies

- Confidentiality of patients and research subjects must be safeguarded (HIPAA privacy rule, HITECH Act of 2009, and Federal Policy for the Protection of Human Subjects)
- Address (and equivalent geocode) is considered Protected Health Information (PHI)
- Presents challenge when integrating geocoding and geomarkers into research studies and clinical applications
    - Most existing IRB protocols and institutional data use agreements prevent transmission of PHI over the internet (e.g. Google, ArcGIS Online, Texas A&M Geocoder)
    - IRB approvals are lengthy and may not even be possible depending on original consent forms
    - Different methods introduces differential error, resulting in biased associations between geomarkers and health outcomes
    - Commercial options are cost prohibitive and are not designed for operations at scale
    - Closed source geocoder prevents transparency and reproducibility

# DeGAUSS

```{r fig2, out.width='100%', fig.cap='DeGAUSS Workflow'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/DeG_flow.png')
```

- Decentralized approach for geocoding and deriving community and individual level environmental characteristics
- Reproducible and standardized geomarker assessment while preserving the privacy of PHI (never exposed to the internet)
- Software based on a container framework that reads and writes CSV files
- Does not require extensive computational resources or extensive knowledge of command line and/or geospatial computing

# Applications

- DeGAUSS is open source and can be customized for applications specific to different studies
- Limited use agreement or deidentified dataset (other healthcare systems, government agencies)
- Sharing exposure assessment models
- Electronic health record and registry integration

### Development

The setup shown below utilizes Docker and `R` to build DeGAUSS software that is self-contained and does not require passing PHI to the internet, but a similar workflow can be employed using other programming languages and containerization software.

```{r fig4, out.width='40%', fig.cap='DeGAUSS Development', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('figs/DeG_dev.png')
```

- `R` script: code that performs geospatial task
- `Dockerfile`: instructions to set up the container including installation of operating system, system dependencies, required geospatial datasets, R, and required R packages
- `renv` lockfile: documents sources and versions of R packages required to run the R code

# Summary

<br>
DeGAUSS is a secure, decentralized, and reproducible approach to solving geospatial privacy issues in multi-site studies, but it also excels as a vehicle for making spatiotemporal exposure assessment prediction models findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR).
